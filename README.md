# Slime-Site
A site about slime


My mentee wanted to learn html, css and javascript. She set out to build a website to educate people on what slime is and how to make it. She created a website with a home page, programmatically generated drawings, her own how-to video, and a resources page.

Her project consists of the following files: index.html - landing page of her website style.css - CSS stlye for all pages diy.html - How to video and generated drawings slimeblob.pde, slimedrawing.pde - processing.js files for the drawings, supplies.html - Resources and links for what you need to make slime.

The website is hosted on her github account: https://github.com/pdpham/agame66.github.io

Other than the above files, nothing else is needed to view the website.
